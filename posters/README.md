You can also use A1 or A2 size if that is more portable size for you. The poster should NOT be laminated. Mounting materials will be provided at the poster board onsite. 

All poster boards will be labelled with your workshop name and a poster number. 
If you are presenter, please make reach go the registration desk at 08:30 and one of our volunteers will direct them to the correct boards to set up their poster. 

### Poster Spotlights 
We have Spotlight sessions for posters at 12:20, so please prepare a one-minute presentation of your poster in any format that suits you. This could be simply projecting your poster, using slides with videos or demos, or even bringing portable hardware if possible. Please remember that, due to a tight schedule, presentations must be strictly limited to one minute. You’ll have further time during lunch or at the poster marquee to discuss your work in more detail.
